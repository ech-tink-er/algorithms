MINIMUM SPANNING TREE
==================================================
* **Spanning Tree (ST)**
    * A subset of graph **edges**.
    * In *connected*, *undirected* graphs.
    * Contains all vertices.
    * For a graph with `V` vertices, a ST has `V - 1` edges.
    * Can be constructed using *BFS & DFS*.
* **Minimum** Spanning Tree (MST)
    * A spanning tree, with the minimum total edge weight.
    * For *disconnected* graphs, there is a minimum spanning **forest**.
    * For an *unweighted* graph, all spanning trees, are minimum.
        - One minimum spanning tree for each *component*.
    * If each edge has a **distinct** weight,
        then there is only one MST.
* MST Cycle Property

    For an edge `e` in cycle `C` in graph `G`, if `e` has a weight,
    **strictly** greater than, any other edge of `C`, then
    `e` doesn't belong to **any MST** of `G`.

    A cycle with `V` vertices has `V` edges, but a ST of a cycle
    needs only `V - 1` edges. So if any edge has a weight,
    **strictly** greater than all the others in the cycle,
    it will **never** a part if an MST of that cycle.

    * Used in MST verification algorithms.

Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
-------------------------
1. Start the tree at an arbitrary vertex.
2. Grow the tree, by the next smallest edge, that connects
    to a vertex, not already in the tree.
3. Repeat 2, until all vertices are in the tree.
* Unless modified, Prim's algorithm doesn't work for disconnected graphs.
* When implementing Prim with a **binary heap**, add edges to the heap
    after adding a vertex to the tree.
    - Same trick as with Dijkstra.
* Complexity
    - On Edges
        * Linear Search: **O(E^2)**.
        * Binary Heap: **O((ElgE)**.
    - On Vertices
        - min(vertex) = min(edges(vertex))
        * Linear Search: **O(V^2)**.
        * Binary Heap: **O((V + E)lgV)**.
        * Fibonacci Heap: **O(E + VlgV)**.

Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Forest)
-------------------------
1. Make a forest, out of each vertex.
2. Sort the edges by weight.
3. Connect any two trees, where possible, with their shortest connecting edge.
4. Discard any edges, that connect vertices in the same tree.
5. Continue until all edges are considered.
* *Efficient* implementations require the use of the **Disjoint-Set Structure**.
* Complexity is **O(ElogV)**
