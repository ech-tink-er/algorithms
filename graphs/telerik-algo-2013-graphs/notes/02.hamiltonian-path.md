HAMILTONIAN PATH
==================================================
* Visits every **vertex** exactly once.
* Can't revisit *edges* as that would revisit *vertices*.
* Aka traceable path.
* A hamiltonian cycle is a hamiltonian path, that is a cycle.
* A hamiltonian graph is a connected graph with a hamiltonian cycle.
* Every complete graph, with more than 2 vertices, is hamiltonian.
    - In a **complete** graph every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

#### Traveling Salesman Problem (Finding Min Hamiltonian Cycle)
Given an undirected weighted graph, find a min hamiltonian cycle, if
one exsists.

* Both TSP and hamiltonian cycle detection,
    are solved using the same algorithms.
* Problem is NP-Hard, no polynomial time algorithm is known.
* Brute-Force
    * Enumerate all vertex permutations to find the min one.
    * Time complexity is **O(N!)**.
* Help-Karp Algorithm
    * Dynamic programming version of the brute-force method.
    * Time complexity is **O(n^2*2^N)**.
